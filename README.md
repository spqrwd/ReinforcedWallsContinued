# Reinforced Walls (continued) for RimWorld

Based on the original [Reinforced-Walls](https://github.com/Neceros/Reinforced-Walls) by NECEROS.

Several aspects of the mod can be tweaked in the mod settings if you have Imranfish's XML Extensions enabled.

Adds expensive heavy reinforced walls and embrasures, with triple base hit points over vanilla walls. They also have a significant damage resistance against breach weapons, mining, thump cannons, basic projectiles, and explosions. Unlocked by researching one new industrial level technology, which (by default) requires a hi-tech research bench to complete. Also adds a new buffed version of the security door if you have the Anomaly DLC enabled.

Should work with all stony and metallic materials, even modded if they belong to one of those categories.
