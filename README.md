# Reinforced Walls (continued) for RimWorld

Based on the original [Reinforced-Walls](https://github.com/Neceros/Reinforced-Walls) by NECEROS.

Adds expensive heavy reinforced walls and embrasures, with triple base hit points over vanilla walls. They also have a significant damage resistance against breach weapons, mining, thump cannons, basic projectiles, and explosions. Unlocked by researching one new industrial level technology, which (by default) has a pre-requisite to Microelectronics and requires a hi-tech research bench.

Several aspects of the mod can be tweaked in the mod settings, powered by XML Extensions (required mod dependency).

Should work with all stony and metallic materials, even modded if they belong to one of those categories.
